Names in HTML5 AppCache are case-sensitive. Thus the path of a file must be exactly
the same as used in QV. Since in CSS themes are small letters so they must be in the
file system. QV server-side automatically generates HTML5 cache manifest from
existing files under the QV root.

Path names in CSS must correspond to the names of the files exactly. This also applies
to CSS and JS paths in HTML.
